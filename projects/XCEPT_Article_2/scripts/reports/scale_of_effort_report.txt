  Difference: 2.0 pp


5. KEY FINDINGS
--------------------------------------------------

Most effective boost: V_rate_boost
  Expected AG reduction: 78.3%
  Improvement over baseline: 1.8 pp

Violence increase (+30%) impact:
  AG reduction: 76.4% (baseline: 76.5%)
  This confirms violence undermines peace interventions.
